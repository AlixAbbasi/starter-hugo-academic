I am a tenure-track faculty at CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security at Saarland University. My research interests include embedded systems security, security of mission-critical real-time software, and secure space and automotive systems. I lead the Embedded Security group at CISPA, which develops and implement new methods to protect embedded systems against various classes of attacks, both on the hardware and firmware level.
